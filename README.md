# Bill Calculator
This is a Spring Boot application that integrates with a third-party currency
exchange API to retrieve real-time exchange rates. The application calculates the total
payable amount for a bill in a specified currency after applying applicable discounts. The
application exposes an API endpoint that allows users to submit a bill in one currency
and get the payable amount in another currency.
